# Progress

## Checkpoint 1: Initial Setup
- Set up the Spring Boot project with Kotlin and Maven.
- Fixed the `TrueDataTrackingZiadAadimApplication.kt` file to align with Spring Boot conventions.
- Removed unnecessary `Interaction().Question()` call.
- Verified the application runs without errors and loads successfully.
- Decided on the next steps to set up the controller, views, and data tracking.
