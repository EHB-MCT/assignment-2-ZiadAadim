# True Data Tracking Project

## Description
This project is a Spring Boot application built with Kotlin to track and visualize user interactions. The application collects and analyzes user behavior data, such as navigation paths, time spent on pages, and actions like "Go Back" clicks. It visualizes this data using dynamic charts for insights and user analytics.

This project is part of a larger goal to develop an interactive drawing course application, where similar tracking features will provide feedback and improve user engagement.

## Features
- **User Interaction Tracking**:
    - Tracks navigation paths, button clicks, and "Go Back" actions.
    - Logs time spent on pages and specific user actions.

- **Dynamic Analytics Visualization**:
    - Real-time visualization of navigation paths, time spent, and go-back rates using Chart.js.
    - Aggregated data presented in user-friendly charts.

- **User-Specific Analytics**:
    - View individual user navigation paths and time spent in each category.
    - Identify the category where users spend the most time.

- **Administrative Features**:
    - Clear all tracked data with a single button click.
    - Total user count and user ID listing.
